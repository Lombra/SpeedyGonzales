# SpeedyGonzales

Displays your current or maximum movement speed in a small standalone frame or via a LibDataBroker feed.

### **Usage**
- /speedy - Opens configuration window

Absolute units are based on the assumption that base running speed is 7 meters or yards per second. Meters and yards are used interchangibly across different locales, and so are treated as the same distance for purposes of the calculations in this addon.
